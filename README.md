# Full-Stack Online Quiz

## Project Description

This project was developed in the web programming unit, COSC260, at UNE. It is a simplified demo of an online quiz. A home page has a login with client-side validation. This is then validated on the server where a unique user name is generated. Details are stored in a file, to simulate the database. A welcome screen, displays the start quiz button. Ajax is used to serve up the quiz questions. Project features include:
  -responsive design using Bootstrap framework
  -jQuery Ajax requests
  -client and server side validation
  -PHP backend deploy using Heroku
